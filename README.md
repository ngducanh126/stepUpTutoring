This is a project I worked on while I was a front-end software engineer at Step Up tutoring, a NGO that helps over 250 students in the USA receive free tutoring services. I helped developed the software for tutors to manage their students

Since I no longer work for the project, I do not have access to the github repo. I have, instead, uploaded the sourcecode to my own repo.

I worked on the "Tutor Portal" feature, a feature for tutors to manage their students.

My code can be found in  "\stepup\app\packages\dashboard\src\pages\tutoring". I worked on the code in this directory.
